[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

---

PART 2 – CREATE JENKINS JOB

Step 1: Create new job
New Item
Enter name: webhook-demo
Select Freestyle project
Click OK

Step 2: Configure Git repository
Source Code Management → Git
Enter repository URL
[https://github.com/username/my-test-repo.git](https://github.com/username/my-test-repo.git)

Step 3: Add build step
Build → Execute Windows Batch Command
echo "Build triggered by GitHub Webhook"

Save the job

---

PART 3 – INSTALL REQUIRED PLUGINS

Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins → Available
Install: GitHub Integration Plugin
Install: Email Extension Plugin

Restart Jenkins if required

---

PART 4 – EXPOSE JENKINS USING NGROK

Download ngrok from
[https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download)

Add auth token (optional)
ngrok config add-authtoken <token>

Start tunnel
ngrok http 8080

Copy the HTTPS forwarding URL displayed
Example:
[https://abc123.ngrok-free.app](https://abc123.ngrok-free.app)

---

PART 5 – CONFIGURE GITHUB WEBHOOK

Open GitHub repository
Settings → Webhooks → Add Webhook

Payload URL
[https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/github-webhook/](https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/github-webhook/)

Content type
application/json

Event trigger
Just the push event

Add webhook

---

PART 6 – CONFIGURE JENKINS FOR WEBHOOK

Open job
webhook-demo → Configure

Build Triggers
Enable
GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling

Save

---

PART 7 – TEST WEBHOOK

Edit any file in the GitHub repository
Example edit test.txt
Add text
Hello Jenkins Webhook Test

Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Webhook test"
git push origin main

Expected result
GitHub sends webhook
ngrok forwards to Jenkins
Jenkins job starts automatically
Console output shows
Build triggered by GitHub Webhook

Manual webhook test
GitHub → Settings → Webhooks → Select webhook → Redeliver

---

TROUBLESHOOTING

In job configuration
Source Code Management → Git
Branch
*/main

Manage Jenkins → Configure System
Check GitHub server configuration

---

PART 8 – SMTP EMAIL NOTIFICATION (GMAIL)

Step 1: Create Gmail app password
Google Account
Security → Enable Two Step Verification
Security → App Passwords
Create new password
Copy the 16 character password

Step 2: Configure SMTP in Jenkins
Manage Jenkins → Configure System
Email Notification section

SMTP server
smtp.gmail.com
User
[your-email@gmail.com](mailto:your-email@gmail.com)
Password <app-password>
Use SSL enabled
Port 465

Test mail delivery

Step 3: Add email notification to job
webhook-demo → Configure
Post-Build Actions → Editable Email Notification
Recipient
[your-email@gmail.com](mailto:your-email@gmail.com)
Enable triggers such as Failure and Success
Save

---

COMMON COMMANDS

Start Jenkins
net start jenkins

Start ngrok
ngrok http 8080

Git push
git add .
git commit -m "Webhook test"
git push

---

FINAL RESULT

Git push triggers webhook
Webhook hits ngrok
ngrok calls Jenkins
Job executes
Email notification is sent

Step 1: Configure Webhook in GitHub
1.	Go to your GitHub repository.
2.	Navigate to Settings → Webhooks.
3.	Click “Add webhook”.
4.	In the Payload URL field:
o	Enter the Jenkins webhook URL in the format:
http://<jenkins-server-url>/github-webhook/
Note: If Jenkins is running on localhost, GitHub cannot access it directly.
Use ngrok to expose your local Jenkins to the internet:

o	ngrok.exe http <Jenkins local host:8080>
	Use the generated ngrok URL, e.g.:
	https://wintry-gloryingly-nam.ngrok-free.dev /github-webhook/
5.	Set Content type to:
application/json
6.	Under “Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?”, select:
o	 Just the push event
7.	Click “Add webhook” to save.
________________________________________
 Step 2: Configure Jenkins to Accept GitHub Webhooks
1.	Open Jenkins Dashboard.
2.	Select the job (freestyle or pipeline) you’ve already created.
3.	Click Configure.
4.	Scroll down to the Build Triggers section.
5.	Check the box: GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling
6.	Click Save.
________________________________________
 Step 3: Test the Setup
1.	Make any code update in your local repo and push it to GitHub.
2.	Once pushed, GitHub will trigger the webhook.
3.	Jenkins will automatically detect the change and start the build pipeline.
________________________________________
outcome
•	You’ve successfully connected GitHub and Jenkins using webhooks.
•	Every time you push code to GitHub, Jenkins will automatically start building your project without manual intervention.

Set-uping the ngrok

How to Install and Use ngrok

Step 1. Download ngrok
https://ngrok.com/download
Download and extract it for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

Step 2. Connect Your ngrok Account (optional but useful)
After you sign up (free), ngrok gives you an auth token.
•	Then got to  Your Authtoken  click here and copy
•	Go ngrok 	command promt
CREATE AUTHENTICATOR [https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken]
Run this command (replace <your_token> with yours):
ngrok config add-authtoken <your_token>
This ensures stable sessions and more control.

Step 3. Start a Tunnel for Jenkins

Assuming Jenkins runs locally on port 8080:
Now Go ngrok 	command prompt and type below commad
ngrok http 8080
You’ll see output like:

Session Status                online
Forwarding                   https://wintry-gloryingly-nam.ngrok-free.dev -> http://localhost:8080
Copy the HTTPS URL (https://wintry-gloryingly-nam.ngrok-free.dev) — this is your public Jenkins URL for webhooks.
Step 4. Use it in GitHub Webhook

In your GitHub repo → Settings → Webhooks:
•	Payload URL: 		 [paste the url generated by ngrok]

https://wintry-gloryingly-nam.ngrok-free.dev /github-webhook/    [please include this – remaining all default]
Now, whenever you push code, GitHub sends an event to that URL, which ngrok forwards to your local Jenkins.
