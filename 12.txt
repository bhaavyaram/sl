Ok BRO now I understand what exactly you want:

➡️ **ONLY STEPS – Plain text – No explanation – No formatting – No decoration**

Here it is:

---

# **WEEK 12 – STEPS ONLY**

## **EC2 INSTANCE CREATION**

1. Login to AWS
2. Go to EC2
3. Click Launch Instance
4. Enter instance name
5. Select Ubuntu Server
6. 64-bit architecture
7. Choose t2.micro
8. Create key pair
9. Download .pem file
10. Configure security group
11. Allow ports 22, 80, 443
12. Keep 8GB storage
13. Launch instance
14. Select instance
15. Click Connect
16. Copy SSH command
17. SSH into the instance

---

## **INSTALL SOFTWARE**

1. sudo apt update
2. sudo apt-get install docker.io
3. sudo apt install git
4. sudo apt install nano

---

## **CLONE PROJECT**

1. git clone <repo-link>
2. cd <project-folder>

---

## **CREATE DOCKERFILE**

1. nano Dockerfile
2. Add:

```
FROM tomcat:latest
COPY target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/
```

3. Save and exit

---

## **BUILD IMAGE**

1. docker build -t myapp-image .
2. docker images

---

## **RUN CONTAINER**

1. docker run -d --name app-demo -p 6060:8080 myapp-image

---

## **ACCESS APPLICATION**

1. Copy EC2 Public IP
2. Open in browser:

```
http://<PUBLIC-IP>:6060
```

3. If blocked, add inbound rule for port 6060 in security group

---

## **FINAL OUTPUT**

1. Web app deployed on Ubuntu EC2
2. Running in Docker
3. Accessible via public IP

Week 12: Creation of virtual machine for Ubuntu OS and Deploying the web application
1.	Creation of virtual machine
2.	Deploying the web application
3.	Accessing it publicly
Deploying an application into cloud
Steps for Deploying  application into the cloud
I.	Create application and  Push into github
II.	Create the virtual machine and connect to it.
III.	Clone the application from github, Write the Dockerfile
IV.	Create the image
V.	Run the image and access it public ip of virtual machine


I.	   Create Maven-web-java project in eclipse & push into github

II.	Create the virtual machine (EC2--instance) in aws and connect to 
Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. 
Ex : Launch ubuntu instnace
Step 1: Login to AWS /canvas account
Step 2: Services --  EC2
Step 3: Choose region which is near ?  
	Services -- EC2 --- Launch Instance 
	Stage 1  --Name (Giving name to the machine) ubuntu
	Stage 2  -- Select AMI  ( Note: Select free tier eligible ) ubuntu server
	Stage 3   --  Architecture as 64-bit	  
	Stage 4  --  Instance type ----  t2.micro(default 1 CPU,1 GB RAM)
	Stage 5  --  Create a new keypair---a keypair will downloaded  with extension .pem
                              Store key in folder AWS
	Stage 6  -- Network Setting ----Create Security group  --  ( It deals with ports )
	(Note for understanding We have 0 to 65535 ports. Every port is dedicated to special purpose)		
Do this step : HERE select http and https
   Stage 7 -- Storage - 8GB ( Observation - we have root - it is same as C Drive)
         Stage 8 --- click on launch instance
    Stage 9: Number of instances ---1
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Observation - One machines created
Do this step:---once it is created select that instance and click on connect
Here copy the ssh – i command from SSH client connect tab
We can use powershell /gitbash /webconsole , to connect to ubuntu machine.
NOTE:- cd path of AWS folder // change path
To connect to above terminals we need to go into the path of the keypair.and 
paste  the
 ssh -i command from the aws console

III.	Clone the application from github, Write the Dockerfile
 once connected to instance

Step 1:-  Run the following commands to install s/w
1.	Update all softwares in Ubuntu by command
sudo apt update
2.	Install docker by command
sudo apt-get install docker.io
3.	Install git by command
sudo apt install git
4.	Install nano( text editor) by command
Sudo apt install nano


	install docker ---apt-get update
-	                            		     apt-get install docker.io
                            apt-get install nano


step 2:-  git clone <paste the github link of maven-web-java project>
step 3:- navigate to the maven-web-java project

VI.	 Create the image

Step 4:-  nano Dockerfile 
 



V.  Run the image and access it with public ip of virtual machine

Step 1:- build your image 
	docker build –t <imagename> .(dot)
Step 2:- check for images
Step 3:- run image
	docker  run –d  --name app-demo –p 6060:8080 <image name>
Step:-4 Accessing the app by public ip of virtual machine
Note:-if your are not able to connect change the inbound rules..
